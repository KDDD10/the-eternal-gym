# Eternal Energy Gym Responsive Website

## Purpose
This website was created for the sole purpose of completing the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Web Application Development course. It was built using the knowledge I gained from HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules. 

The Eternal Energy Gym website was created at the request of the Eternal Energy Gym company. The client had asked for a fully responsive website that can be used to advertise their gym as well as qualities that make them different compared to other gyms. In doing this, they hope that this will increase the amount of people would use their gym and recommend it to others.

## Design
### Colour Scheme 
The main colours used are Gold, White & Black. The most of the colours are black and white but I decided to add Gold to it too as when I was testing it seemed to be a colour that standed out on the Home Page. They seemed to compliment each other without being over powering to the eyes of any user. 
### Typography
The headers on all pages throughout the website is using the **Lato** Font while the rest of the main text is using the **Oswald** font.
### Images
The images used in this project were sourced from different websites. These were [iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/) and [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/)

## Features
### Existing Features
#### Navigation Bar
A fully responsive, sticky navigation bar is present at the top of every page. It has links to the Home, Gallery, and Signup pages in addition to the Logo, which takes you to the Home page. To guarantee easy and intuitive navigation, the website maintains the same layout on all devices. Without taking extra steps or using the browser's navigation buttons, the user can access any area of the website from anywhere on the page thanks to the Navbar.

On a mobile device, it becomes a small menu. The same options are available in this dropdown menu, but they're shown as a column against a semitransparent background.

#### Hero Image
The hero image is what the user sees right away and is visually stimulating. Because visual associations are often very strong, it also aids in delivering the page's semantics. Key selling elements are also included on the front page to aid the user in understanding the website's purpose.
There is no overlay included. Every image has been chosen to complement the color scheme of the website and add to the visual impact of the design. The section heading, which is shown in the color scheme of the block that represents this page on the Home page, follows each image. Color coding facilitates association-building and content navigation for the user.

#### Signup Page
The user can join the community and sign up for Eternal Gym Group on this page. The form on the page requests the user to provide their email address and full name. 

## Responsive Layout
On all screen sizes and resolutions, the website is intended to be adaptable, fluid, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing.All hero images have mobile counterparts, which are smaller and have different aspect ratios, to guarantee optimal performance on mobile devices. Because of how important the photos are to conveying the website's semantics and intended user experience.

## Testing

#### Summary
Time for honesty, I didn't do any testing. I didn't realise that I had to do multiple tests on different web browsers and record the results. So unfornately I have nothing to show in this section.

## Deployment
Another moment of honesty. I was using 'Replit' to do my work for the past few weeks. Once it came round to the last week, I found out I had to use Github and link all my work together. As well as use it to make commits to my work to show that I have been making progress. I tried to figure out how to do that for the past few days and unfortunately I couldn't get it to work. I truly struggled and although I had help, I just couldn't get it to work. So I didn't end up using Github or any use Gits to take progress pictures of my work.

## Challenges

As you can tell, I struggled a lot in this project. I thought I had everything under control by turns out I was very far from it and it has cost me big time. I just hope I can continue learning from my mistakes and do better when the next project rolls round.

I  came across multiple challenges during the final stages of the project. All my own fault as I didn't read the criteria well enough or barely at all.

## Comments

There are a few things I wanted to make clear so that it's easier to understand why some things are the way they are in this readme file as well as the whole Project. 
* The link to my website is on a differentb platform. This is because I didn't use Github or any suitable developing platform. I used 'Replit'. By the time I realised that I had to put all my work on another platform, I struggled to make it work and it was too late. So I decided to just to keep things how they were and hope for the best.
* I didn't keep track of every website I used to help me along the way. It's purely my fault as I should've been more careful when reading the criteria.
* I didn't noticed certain things such as committing my work while doing it to show the progress of the work but when I did notice I tried my best to fix the situation and got some of it done.

As I explained before, I came across multiple challenges. Challenges that held me back to completing the project properly. It's my own fault and I've learnt from it. I gave it my a good try and I truly believed I've come a long way form the start and end of this first project.
